Story: The Mysterious Box

Aarav was walking home from school when he noticed a small wooden box lying near the old banyan tree. 
It looked ancient, with carvings of strange symbols on it. Curious, he picked it up. 
The box was locked, but when he shook it, he heard something rattling inside.

At first, Aarav thought of taking it home. But his best friend Riya, who was walking with him, warned, “What if it belongs to someone dangerous? We shouldn’t meddle.” 
Aarav, however, couldn’t resist. That night, when everyone was asleep, he tried to open the box with a hairpin. 
To his surprise, it clicked open. Inside, he found a folded map and a small silver key.

The map showed their town but marked a spot deep inside the abandoned railway station. 
Aarav told Riya about it the next morning. She was hesitant, but Aarav’s excitement convinced her to join.

When they reached the railway station, it was eerily silent. Dusty tracks and broken windows gave it a haunted look. 
They followed the map and reached an old locker. Aarav inserted the silver key, and with a creak, the locker opened. 
Inside was a small diary wrapped in cloth.

Before Aarav could read it, a man’s voice echoed behind them:
“Put that back! It doesn’t belong to you.”

An old watchman was standing there, holding a lantern. Startled, the children explained how they had found the box. 
The watchman sighed and said, “That diary belonged to a freedom fighter who once lived here. It contains secrets and hidden codes from the independence movement. 
Many people have searched for it, but it was never found until now.”

The children realized the box wasn’t just a random find—it was history itself. Instead of keeping it, they decided to hand it over to the local museum. 
The curator praised them for their honesty, and Aarav finally understood that some treasures are not meant to be kept but to be shared.
